# Todo App

A **minimal and user-friendly Todo application** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
It helps you manage daily tasks efficiently with options to add new tasks, mark them as completed, delete individual ones, or clear the entire list. All tasks are stored in **localStorage**, so your list remains intact even after refreshing the page.
